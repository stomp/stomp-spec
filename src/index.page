    STOMP is the Simple (or Streaming) Text Orientated Messaging Protocol.

    STOMP provides an interoperable wire format so that STOMP clients can
    communicate with any STOMP message broker to provide easy and widespread
    messaging interoperability among many languages, platforms and brokers.

    STOMP is a very simple and easy to implement protocol, coming from the HTTP
    school of design; the server side may be hard to implement well, but it is very
    easy to write a client to get yourself connected. For example you can use
    Telnet to login to any STOMP broker and interact with it\!

    Many developers have told us that they have managed to write a STOMP client in
    a couple of _hours_ to in their particular language, runtime or platform
    into the STOMP network. So if your favored language/runtime of choice does not
    offer a good enough STOMP client don't be afraid to write one.
